# dyna-utils
Simple utilities to interact with .k LsDyna files. Current language available Octave/Matlab.

Developed in everyday use of LsPrePost and LsDyna (most tested with version R9, R11): thus not well documented nor commented, and some files likely to have bugs.
Any help or collaboration is welcomed.

To-do-list:
- bugfixes
- migration to other languages
