# dyna-utils
Simple utilities to interact with .k LsDyna files. Current languages available Matlab and Python.

Developed in everyday use of LsPrePost and LsDyna (most tested with version R9, R11, R13): thus not well documented nor commented, and some files likely to have bugs.
Any help or collaboration is welcome.

To-do-list:
- bugfixes
- enlarging python modules
